# Binance Trade Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing historical trade data from multiple Binance accounts over a 90-day period. The goal is to calculate key financial metrics, rank accounts based on performance, and identify the top 20 accounts.

## Objective
To evaluate trading performance across multiple accounts by computing key financial metrics and ranking them using a weighted scoring system.

## Metrics Calculated
- **ROI (Return on Investment)**: Measures profitability relative to investment.
- **PnL (Profit and Loss)**: Overall gains or losses from trading.
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted return measurement.
- **MDD (Maximum Drawdown)**: Measures the largest decline in portfolio value.
- **Win Rate**: Percentage of profitable trades.
- **Win Positions**: Number of profitable positions.
- **Total Positions**: Total number of trades executed.

## Approach
1. **Data Exploration and Cleaning**
   - Load and inspect the dataset.
   - Handle missing values and inconsistencies.
   
2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Extract relevant trading details.
   - Compute financial metrics for each account.
   
3. **Ranking Algorithm**
   - Develop a weighted scoring system to rank accounts based on key metrics.
   - Normalize data to ensure fair comparisons.
   
4. **Analysis and Insights**
   - Identify top-performing accounts.
   - Visualize key findings using charts and tables.

## Deliverables
- **Jupyter Notebook/Python script**: Contains the complete analysis and code.
- **CSV file**: Includes calculated financial metrics for each account.
- **Report**: Summarizes methodology, key findings, and ranking approach.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides insights into trading performance by evaluating multiple financial indicators. The ranking system helps identify the most profitable and consistent accounts based on trading activity and calculated metrics.
